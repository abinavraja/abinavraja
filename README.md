# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abinav

Iâ€™m passionate about **neuromorphic computing** and the development of **hardware description codes** to create energy-efficient, biologically inspired systems.

## ðŸ§  My Interests

- **Neuromorphic Computing**: I'm fascinated by how we can mimic the brainâ€™s neural networks to design smarter, more power-efficient hardware architectures.
- **Hardware Description Languages (HDL)**: I work with **VHDL** and **Verilog** to design and prototype circuits, particularly for neuromorphic applications.
- **Low-Power VLSI Design**: Reducing energy consumption while maintaining performance is a core focus of my work, especially in **spiking neural networks (SNNs)**.
- **FPGA/ASIC Design**: Iâ€™m exploring how we can use FPGAs and ASICs to implement these neuromorphic architectures in real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

- **Neuromorphic Hardware**: Exploring the intersection of biology and hardware to design energy-efficient processors inspired by the brain.
- **Developing Scalable Solutions**: Focusing on architectures that can scale to real-world problems while maintaining low power usage.
- **Hardware Simulation**: Using tools like **Vivado**, **ModelSim**, and **Quartus** to simulate and validate designs.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning

- **Memristor-based Designs**: Studying how these components can improve neuromorphic computing architectures.
- **Edge Computing**: Integrating neuromorphic systems into edge devices for real-time processing.

## ðŸ’» Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: VHDL, Verilog, Python, C++
- **Platforms**: FPGA, ASIC
- **Simulation Tools**: Vivado, ModelSim, Quartus
- **Neuromorphic Platforms**: Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth
